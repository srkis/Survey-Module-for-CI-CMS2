# Survey-Module-for-CI-CMS2
Pool/Survey module for CI-cms2. This is the self-contained modul which can be installed in Codeigniter and CI-CMS2. When you start the installation anketa_install.php file will make tables for database and after that you can use the Poll. I also adda time limit functionallity so you can decide how manny time users can vote at a specific time. Also, you can create several surveys, but just one will be activated. Implemented Jquery  AJAX, so vote will be done without page refresh. Google chart will show survey results based on users answer, and will be calculated and displayed in percentages for each answer. REST api, CURL library, licence Auth and much more included in this project, so you can parse this pool/survey as a client.
